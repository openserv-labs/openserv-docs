# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and community managers have developed this Community Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) as a pledge to ensure that participation in our community is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, political views, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, and/or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other people

- Gracefully accepting genuine feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, threats, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing or collecting others' private confidential information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

## Our Responsibilities

OpenServ Team are the main organizers responsible for mediating challenging situations. We will always prioritize a sense of safety and belonging, and pursuing the well-being of individuals and communities. We acknowledge many of the issues every community deals with may arise from systemic circumstances and we will do our best seeking to foster a more just and equitable society.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject posts, replies, code, links, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that are  deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

OpenServ Team may also appoint Community Moderators, empowered with the discretion to review and restrict content.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces.  It also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces or attending community events. Examples of representing a project or community include: 
- using an official project email address
- posting via an official social media account, or 
- acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 

Representation of the community may be further defined and clarified by the OpenServ Team and OpenServ reserves the right to modify this Code of Conduct at its discretion and by the community needs.

## When Problems Arise

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior by community members should be reported by contacting the OpenServ Community Team at community@openserv.ai    

We are committed to investigating any reported violations of our Code of Conduct and taking appropriate steps to address the concerns of those affected, with a focus on prioritizing the needs of individuals who have experienced harm. If a member violates our Code of Conduct, we may consider a range of actions to address the situation. 
Depending on the severity of the situation, we may need to take corrective actions, such as providing training and/or mediation. In some cases, penalties such as a temporary suspension or a permanent ban from the community may be necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of all members.

## What Happens After a Violation is Reported

Community leaders will create a report and take appropriate action. The report will be reviewed by the OpenServ Team and the appropriate action will be taken. The report will be kept confidential and the identity of the reporter will be protected.

We will always have restorative justice approach at the forefront of our actions, and we will always prioritize the needs of individuals who have experienced harm.

After a violation is reported, the OpenServ Team will take the following steps:

1. Investigate the incident
2. Gather information from all relevant parties
3. Determine the appropriate action
4. Take action in accordance with the OpenServ Team's Code of Conduct
5. Communicate the outcome of the investigation and the action taken with the reporter and the community
6. Provide support and resources to the individual who has experienced harm
7. Review and update our Code of Conduct as needed to ensure it remains effective and relevant
